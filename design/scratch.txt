FROM SOLUTIONS TO EXERCISE
- Display all 9 options each time
- Display
  a. Number of records in memory (i.e. CDs)
  b. Current file name (or None)
  each time before displaying options
```
 There are currently {} records in the system
 No current filename | Current filename: {}

  ```
- Show what option user chose, wait him/her to press ENTER before moving on
- If user choses to quit with unsaved records prompt to save to a file


PROGRAM LOGIC and STRUCTURE
all unsaved records will live in memory
a var needs to keep track of all unsaved records
a counter needs to track number of unsaved records
- PRINT starting_message
- WHILE user wants to continue
    PRINT all options
    IF quit selected exit the loop
    ELSE run the relavent function




FUNCTIONS

create_list()
- create a new file
- if current file is not saved with save_list() ask to save before creating a new file
- ask for a file name
- if given name exists 
  a. ask for a new name
  b. ask to append to the file [ append_list() ]

open_list()


save_list()
- save unsaved records in memory to currently opened file
- if there is no such file ask for one
- if there are no unsaved records this function should complain about it
- for data integrity this should do one of 2 things
    1. save list created by create_list() function
    2. save same list created by open_list() function after some modifications
- once function successfully completes number of unsaved records should be 0

save_list_as()
- like save_list() except the fact that this will save list to a new file
- need user to give the name of under which list should be saved
- if it is the same as currently open file --> complain

append_list()


create_record()
- print how many records are currently in memory to save
- print required prompts

display_record()


display_all_records()
